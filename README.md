# IoT-Project
The IoT based Automatic plant watering system  helps maintain proper moisture levels in indoor plants. The system is cost-effective, user-friendly, and  customizable according to the plant’s water needs.
Today's busy lifestyle makes it difficult for people to find time to regularly water their plants, which could result in neglect and possible damage to the plants.
It is difficult to provide plants with the proper amount of water required if soil moisture levels are not precisely monitored. In addition to harming the plants, overwatering them consumes water, which is a significant problem when it comes to sustainability and water conservation. 
Hence, this project offers a solution to these issues by conserving water by avoiding overwatering, encouraging plant growth and health by maintaining steady moisture levels and offering ease by automating the watering process.

The project is developed using a soil moisture sensor that senses the moisture level, a water pump to deliver water, and an Arduino Uno to process the sensor data and control the pump. The software determines the watering intervals based on real-time soil moisture readings. The system monitors soil moisture and hence provides the perfect amount of water required by the plant. It can be improved to add water logging alarms, aridity alarms. It doesn’t need special attention. Can be trained to be self-learning and adapt to seasons and weather.
